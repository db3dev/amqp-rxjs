This example requires that you have an amqp message broker running locally with port 5672 exposed. The easiest way to have this setup is to install docker and run ```docker-compose up -d``` which will deploy a basic rabbitmq setup on the required port.

```npm start``` will do npm i, transpile code and start the example with an inspecter port opened on 5858.
